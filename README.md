#Love Spinner
This was a quick project that I made for a coworker who was doing a "random" wheel spinning to pick a date for Valentines Day. He thought it would be a romantic to make sure that the spinner landed on his crush so he asked me to make sure that the wheel would always land on the first name. It as a fun quick project.
